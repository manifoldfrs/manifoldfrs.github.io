I'm sitting in the AGI House in SF at the moment, having had the priviledge of attending [Holy Books: Religion Reading Night](https://partiful.com/e/mKighhJFNzw8dOx4GRYK?update=bXE9ubqxr2xtTxuYThPwX). The goal is to read through a religious textbook that interests you and share your thoughts and ideas with the rest of the group. Tonight I spent the last hour reading through [Gateless Gate](https://a.co/d/4X0TXFZ), a collection of short but deep stories or koans on Zen Buddhism. One story in particular gripped me:

## Not the Wind, Not the Flag

> The wind was flapping a temple flag, and two monks were having an argument about it. One said, "The flag is moving." The other said, "The wind is moving." They argued back and forth but could not reach the truth. The sixth patriarch said, "It is not the wind that moves. It is not the flag that moves. It is your mind that moves." The two monks were struck with awe.

## On the nature of Religion

Perspective often shifts one's understanding of reality, and by extension, spirituality. Think of the philosophical thought experiment:

`If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?`

We are challenged to consider the relationship between observation and reality. What we perceive as reality is often a construct of our minds, and religion often addresses existential questions and seeks to explain the nature of reality and the divine. Perspective plays a crucial role in how individuals interpret these teachings. Personal religious experiences can vary greatly, shaping one's beliefs and understanding of spiritual truths. Different denominations and faith traditions interpret sacred texts differently, highlighting how your perspective influences religious doctrine and practice. Not even adding in the different cultural and individual backgrounds that can affect how religious stories and teaching are understood and valued.

## Parallels in Christianity

As a Christian myself, there are many stories in the Bible that explore similar themes of perception and understanding, think of [Luke 24:13-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024:13-35&version=NIV):

```
13 Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles[a] from Jerusalem. 14 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. 15 As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; 16 but they were kept from recognizing him.

17 He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?”

They stood still, their faces downcast. 18 One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”

19 “What things?” he asked.

“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. 20 The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; 21 but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. 22 In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning 23 but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. 24 Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”

25 He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” 27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.

28 As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. 29 But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.

30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 32 They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”

33 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” 35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
```

After Jesus' crucifixion, two of his disciples walk to the village of Emmaus, discussing what has happened. Jesus joins them, but they do not recognize him. It's only when Jesus breaks bread with them that their eyese are opened. The disciples' inability to recognize Jesus reflects how grief and expectations can cloud perception.

## Closing thoughts

It's interesting to see how what you perceive shapes the deepest aspects of your own life. Understanding often requires a shift in your perspective. Anyway, I enjoyed the vibes of this reading night, not only could you find books on Buddhism and Christianity, but also on Atheism, [AGI and how it could be the second coming of Christ](https://www.amazon.com/AGI-Divine-Unveiling-Mysteries-Intelligence/dp/B0CGWMLRJ9), and even books on satanic cults. The goal was to explore your curiosity wherever it led and to share that knowledge with the rest of the community. I'm looking forward to similar events on other deep topics.
