Inspired by the methodology of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), I figured it wouldn't hurt to make a blog post describing past diets that have worked for me and what my current plan is. Mostly, it's to keep me honest, but if it helps some of you out, then that's a plus.

## From 225 lbs to 175 lbs

I've tried many diets over the years, but the most beneficial one for me was an [Animal-Based Diet](https://www.paulsaladinomd.co/ab-guide). If you're not familiar with it, it's pretty simple:

- Nose-to-tail meat
- Fruit
- Raw Dairy
- Honey

This diet took me from 225 lbs to 175 lbs in 2 years. The reason it works is the reason that most diets work: **the modern American diet is shit.** Removing junk like processed foods, oils, and sugar works wonders for anyone, whether you're a vegan or a carnivore. In this case, an animal-based diet (_God, I hate that name_) was beneficial because I could satisfy my sugar cravings with natural fructose. Advocates of this diet will tell you that calories don't matter, and while that might work for some people, if you're trying to lose weight, you'll eventually have to keep track of your calories; there's no getting around the First Law of Thermodynamics. Try to limit your consumption of fruit, honey, and raw dairy if you're losing weight with this diet too.

I supplemented these foods with Heart & Soil supplements and Vitamin D since I knew I wasn't getting enough sunlight coding inside most days. The supplements that worked most for me were:

- [Naturewise Vitamin D3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J2ZA8HI?amp=&crid=73ZVZ516WIMW&amp=&sprefix=vitamind+d): Not much to explain here; if you're not getting enough sunlight, which is basically everybody on this planet, then you should supplement with some kind of Vitamin D.
- [Heart & Soil Whole Package](https://shop.heartandsoil.co/products/whole-package): Useful for exercise recovery and performance.
- [Fire Starter](https://shop.heartandsoil.co/products/fire-starter): Good for appetite control and Vitamin K2.
- [Bone Matrix](https://shop.heartandsoil.co/products/bone-matrix): I wasn't taking much dairy, so I needed this for calcium.

Other vitamins and minerals I could get from meat like liver, heart, ground beef, and fruits (whether it's organic or not doesn't matter). If you're not sure where to get liver and other organs from, you can take Heart & Soil supplements.

I was also working out about 3-4 times a week. My usual routine was 30-60 minutes of cardio combined with weight lifting and kettlebell lifts. I would also do a longer run (60-120 minutes) once per week.

## Don't be a Zealot

Most diets will help people lose weight, but there's no need to be tribal about it. Some advocates of this diet will tell you that you should touch your feet to the grass and sun your balls while you're at it. I can safely say I did none of that crap while following this diet. Though certain things like getting more sunlight are beneficial, I'm too busy to track minor stuff like this. **Make the diet work for you, not the other way around.**

## Current Meal Plan: Slow Carb Diet + Blueprint Protocol

While the animal-based diet was helpful for losing a good chunk of weight, more often than not, I found myself tired and mentally dependent on caffeine or other stimulants for my job. I also got bored of eating the same foods over and over again. So I decided to switch it up to the popular diet by Tim Ferriss called the [Slow Carb Diet](https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tim_ferriss_the-4-hour-chef_one_pager_slow_carb_diet.pdf). This is another simple diet; you'll notice that I typically like the simple ones because I hate overthinking diets:

- Lean Proteins
- Legumes
- Cruciferous Vegetables
- No calorie-packed drinks

The added bonus is you get one refeed/cheat day per week to go nuts. I love these days for exploring new foods and going out and socializing with friends. Over time, as Tim Ferriss describes, you learn not to go too ape shit during these days because the next day you will feel absolutely terrible. These days I tend to take it as more of a refeed day than a cheat day, meaning I'll eat on a slight calorie surplus but with (mostly) healthy foods.

Like the animal-based diet, most will advocate for not counting calories, but again there's no getting past the First Law of Thermodynamics. I still found myself tired often; Ferriss will recommend a [supplement stack](https://tim.blog/pagg/) to go along with this diet, but mileage tends to vary for most who follow the Slow-Carb Diet. I tried sticking with Heart & Soil supplements, but nothing changed; that's when I decided to give the [Blueprint Supplement Stack](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/supplement-stack) a try and noticed my energy levels significantly improved. The vitamins and minerals are more potent than any other brand of vitamins I've tried. [Near has a deeper dive into the supplement stack](https://near.blog/blueprint-1-0-review/) if you're curious. I highly recommend the stack if you have the budget, you're on a restrictive diet, and you can't get all your nutrients from food.

### Meal Prep

I haven't always been the most meticulous when it comes to tracking food, calories, and macros while working out. I've been better at it these days because I find myself eating the same meals and have more interest in performing optimally for my jiu-jitsu workouts and work. So now, with the exception of my refeed days, I'll break down exactly what I eat and take in a day; the only macros I track at the moment is total calories and protein consumption. I typically aim for 1700 calories and 140g of protein per day:

#### Meal 1: Nutty Pudding Mix

### Fitness

Over the years I've tried several fitness plans and programs to stay healthy. This part isn't so hard since I grew up playing football and track & field. I've tried creating my own workout plans, crossfit, barry's, orange theory, and workout plans by fitness gurus like Jim Wendler and other internet bros, but nothing makes me feel more alive than jiu-jitsu. I haven't practiced all that long, but I highly recommend it for any nerds who like to strategize while getting a workout in. My typical flow is:

- 6 20-30 minutes of cardio in the morning per week
- 3-4 Jiu-Jitsu sessions per week

You can substitute Jiu-Jitsu with any kind of workout you prefer. If I'm traveling and there's no martial arts gym around, I'll typically go for a kettlebell workout like [Simple and Sinister](https://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Revised-Updated/dp/0989892433?dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fdSMQgWAAMrno6xOOW59RkjDnErlcmS4x8NAQwNK1iur4RVKMXENWV1RMc4OIuvjKRCg1G6CNGn-54Lh3OUKEvnRNKNnwZ37qCcL5HwWi2h9mJiaIA6-E8uGY0T_EbBj_3sz-DJQ7uZqGj_8o21fey9XmL5qaVVw6OjFhv6SNjvnw08kFxzaW3TGyRSfDKCXJEzxpewR8AOP0oxedN_K0M04chj4yIbvRMOg5V7yqk0.PKQhgDLEUXU1cqbxDP4cx0uOlKI77b7maj8R-gheFuQ&qid=1716766839&sr=8-1) or a program from the [NTC app](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app).

### Conclusion

After switching diets, I've been able to maintain my weight at around 170-175 lbs. The next step is to focus on gaining lean muscle while maintaining my weight, but I'd rather focus on getting better at jiu-jitsu. Finding a diet and fitness plan that works for you is a personal journey. What worked for me might not work for you, but the key is to stay consistent and make adjustments as needed. The best diet is the one you can stick to in the long term. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need support. I'll write another post on jiu-jitsu in the future and update this post when I discover new insights.
