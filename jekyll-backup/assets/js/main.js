/**
 * @description
 * This is the main JavaScript file for the website.
 * It can be used to include site-wide JavaScript functionalities,
 * initialize plugins, or orchestrate other scripts.
 *
 * For now, it is empty but serves as a placeholder for future global scripts.
 * Specific functionalities like mobile navigation or code copying are handled
 * in their respective dedicated script files (e.g., navigation.js, code-copy.js)
 * and are also linked in the <head>.
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - None directly in this file, but other scripts might be loaded alongside it.
 *
 * @notes
 * - If this file remains empty, consider removing its reference from `_includes/head.html`
 *   unless it's anticipated to be used soon.
 * - Alternatively, other small scripts could be consolidated here if they don't warrant
 *   separate files.

// Site-wide JavaScript can be added here.
// For example, initializing global plugins or common event listeners.

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // console.log("Main JavaScript file loaded.");
  // Add any global initializations here.
});
