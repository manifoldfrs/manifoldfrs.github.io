"Grief is a terrible thing." - Robert Ford, Westworld

When the rug is pulled out from under you, it's hard to know what to do, even harder to know who you are. I'm not interested in going into the details of my grief, but I will say that it can also make you introspect into your own life and the choices you've made...and hopefully make you grow. Through this experience, I realized I could help build something meaningful.

# Shaya

Recently I co-founded [Shaya](https://www.shaya.so), a storytelling platform designed to foster lived experiences and understand different perspectives. I've always loved projects like [Humans of New York](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/) and [Soft White Underbelly](https://www.softwhiteunderbelly.com/) because they allow everyday people to share their raw authentic stories and experiences without judgement, and in doing so, foster a deeper understanding of the human condition. The goal is to instill the kind of understanding that helps connect people rather than divide them.

# A Turning Point in Perspective

Yesterday I listened to JRE with [Marc Andreessen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8MOfxD5nU). In it, he shared a story that led to him rethinking his worldview. On the night of the 2016 election, Andreessen and his friends were at a restaurant in Palo Alto, surrounded by an atmosphere of grief and despair. In the middle of that somber dinner, a young waiter offered a perspective that cut through the gloom: his immigrant father admired Trump and saw him as a symbol of opportunity.

That raw moment challenged Andreessen to rethink everything he thought he understood about the world, and consequently influenced his outlook on the 2024 election. Regardless of your politics, the young waiter's comment is a reminder that no single narrative captures the full truth. Understanding requires us to listen to voices we might not consider or agree with.

# What's next?

To be clear, Shaya is not a social media platform. Platforms like X, Blue Sky, and Reddit are designed to prioritize broadcasting, engagement metrics (likes, reposts, karma), and attention-seeking behavior. While they allow for conversation, their structure often leads to polarization, superficial interactions, and echo chambers. Instead, Shaya is designed to help you understand perspectives from all over the world. How are we doing this exactly? More on that soon.

If this resonates with you, [reach out](mailto:faris@shaya.so). My Co-Founder and I are looking for support in Marketing, Communications, and Design. And if you're in the Bay Area, let's grab a coffee.

I'm excited to provide more updates, so stay tuned.
