Here’s an update from my previous post in May.

## Exploring and Settling on Keto

Starting a company is hard; maintaining your weight while doing so can be just as challenging. During the summer, my weight increased from about 175 lbs to around 187 lbs. It’s not a huge gain, but I’m cautious about gradual weight increases, especially after being overweight for close to 30 years.

Noticing the weight creeping up in August, and knowing I’d be working more, I decided to try the [ketogenic diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499830/). I enjoy mostly eating meat and staying low carb, and your brain on ketones can feel like a [superpower](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840718/). However, it typically takes 2–3 months for your body to adapt to running on ketones. You could fast or do a lot of cardio to speed the process, but even then your body might resist ketosis at first. I’m impatient and wanted full ketosis in under a month.

My solution? Use Ozempic. It’s a GLP-1 receptor agonist that helps lower blood sugar and suppress appetite. (Do your own research on GLP-1 agonists; I suggest following [Peter Attia’s work](https://peterattiamd.com/ama64/)). We don’t know all of the long-term effects, but I decided to try it for a month to jump-start keto. In that month, I lost 10 lbs (from 187 to 177), but I felt very fatigued and had low energy during workouts and daily tasks. Surprisingly, Ozempic also cut down my cravings for quick dopamine hits, including alcohol. I now average only 1–2 drinks of scotch per week.

After a month, once I was producing enough ketones, I stopped the Ozempic shots and fully followed a ketogenic diet.

## Daily Routine

My daily keto macros are:

- **Fats**: ~70–75% of total calories
- **Proteins**: ~20–25% of total calories
- **Carbohydrates**: ~5–10% of total calories

For a daily intake of about 1,880 calories:

- **Fats**: ~146 grams
- **Proteins**: ~96 grams
- **Carbohydrates**: ~23 grams

This is based on a Basal Metabolic Rate of around 1,840 calories. I like using supplements to optimize my nutrition, but it’s important to learn how your body responds to different diets and supplements. I still use the Blueprint supplement stack, along with products from [Heart & Soil](https://heartandsoil.com/). I’ve also increased electrolytes to account for ketosis and near-daily workouts.

Here’s my current supplement and meal plan:

### Morning

- [LMNT Zero Hot Chocolate Mix](https://a.co/d/4UWeVij) – 1 packet
- [Bulletproof MCT Oil](https://a.co/d/8xlIz03) – 1 packet
- [Lion’s Mane](https://a.co/d/56gdkb4) – 2

### Afternoon

- [Heart & Soil Whole Package](https://shop.heartandsoil.co/products/whole-package) – 6
- [Hearty & Soil Bone Matrix](https://shop.heartandsoil.co/products/bone-matrix) – 3
- [Hearty & Soil Firestarter](https://shop.heartandsoil.co/products/fire-starter) – 6
- [EPA/DHA/DPA](https://a.co/d/4hwvcoU) – 1000mg
- [Garlic](https://a.co/d/cfxh658) – 1.2g
- [Kirkland 100% Grass Fed Beef Patties](https://www.costcobusinessdelivery.com/kirkland-signature-grass-fed-beef-patties%2C-13-lb-patty%2C-15-ct.product.100358331.html) – 2 patties
- [Maple Valley Salted Butter](https://a.co/d/6Yd84OI) – 4 tbsp

### Snacks

- [A keto-friendly protein bar](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/macadamia-protein-bar) – 1 bar
- [Maple Valley Salted Butter](https://a.co/d/6Yd84OI) – 1–2 tbsp with black coffee
- [Another LMNT packet](https://a.co/d/68wdIaO) – 1 packet if needed

Most of these supplements are similar to what I used earlier this year. I’m currently experimenting with Lion’s Mane for cognitive focus; it might be working or could just be a placebo. I might drop it in a month or two.

### Workout Routine

I increased my workouts from three days a week to six. My body can build muscle even while losing fat—possibly a [genetic advantage](https://you.23andme.com/published/reports/82c6897d0c284e82a7a085904777d615/), though I’m not complaining. I follow a simplified routine based on Jim Wendler’s [5/3/1 approach](https://t-nation.com/t/5-3-1-how-to-build-pure-strength/281694) for three of those days:

- 5x5 Deadlift or Squat
- 5x5 Bench Press
- 5x5 Military Press

I add a supplemental exercise for each core lift, then an ab workout. On the other three days, I do a HIIT workout on an assault bike, attend a hot yoga class, or do another form of cardio. On my rest day, I usually take a long walk or hike. Consistency is key, which is why I keep the daily workouts relatively short. Good sleep is also extremely important; I average 6–7 hours a night. If I have trouble sleeping, I might take [melatonin](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CDABRUW/?coliid=I2EFJ0IJFBMO96&colid=OCRLL2WUBBTJ).

### Conclusion

After switching to keto and sticking with a system that works for me, I’m at about 168 lbs—down from 187 lbs earlier this summer. I’ve even developed noticeable [obliques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4wQM9o3nOY).

Most importantly, my energy is through the roof. I can plan high-level strategies, code, lift heavy, and still have energy for life’s other responsibilities. The only thing I miss is jiu-jitsu, which I paused to focus on my startup. I hope to return to it in the future, but for now, this routine is working well. I hope this post inspires you to find a diet and fitness plan that fits your demands, too.
