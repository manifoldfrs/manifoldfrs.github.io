# Task: Add Delphi Mind Page

## Plan

### Overview
Create a new page titled "Let us not talk falsely now" that embeds the Delphi mind interface. This page should be accessible via the main navigation, positioned after the "Blog" link.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create the page file**
   - Create a new file `_pages/delphi.md` with appropriate frontmatter
   - Include the Delphi embed scripts and container

2. **Update navigation**
   - Modify `_data/navigation.yml` to add the new page link after "Blog"
   - Use the title "Let us not talk falsely now"

3. **Page content**
   - The page should contain the Delphi embed with the provided configuration
   - Ensure proper script loading and container sizing
   - Style the page to match the site's Nord theme

### Technical Details
- The Delphi embed requires two script tags and specific configuration
- Container dimensions: 100% width, 800px height
- Config ID: 2d7d62d0-9cd9-4c2d-ba8a-4b009dc124fc
- Landing page override: OVERVIEW

### Files to modify/create:
1. `_pages/delphi.md` - New page file
2. `_data/navigation.yml` - Add navigation entry

Please review this plan before I proceed with implementation.

### Implementation Completed

I have successfully implemented the Delphi mind page as planned. Here's what was done:

1. **Created the page file** (`pages/delphi.tsx`):
   - Used the Next.js page structure with Layout component
   - Added the page title "Let us not talk falsely now"
   - Embedded the Delphi interface using Next.js Script components
   - Styled the container with Nord theme colors (bg-background-darker)
   - Set container dimensions to 100% width and 800px height as specified

2. **Updated navigation** (`components/Navigation/index.tsx`):
   - Added the new navigation item after "Blog" as requested
   - Used the full title "Let us not talk falsely now" in the navigation
   - Link points to `/delphi`

### Technical Implementation Details

- The Delphi embed is implemented using two Script components with the exact configuration provided:
  - Config ID: `2d7d62d0-9cd9-4c2d-ba8a-4b009dc124fc`
  - Landing page override: `OVERVIEW`
  - Container dimensions preserved as specified
- The page follows the same structure as other pages in the site (e.g., about.tsx)
- Maintains consistency with the site's styling and layout

### Next Steps

The page is now accessible at `/delphi` route when the site is running. The Delphi embed will load when users navigate to the page.
