# Fix Mobile Experience - Plan

## Issue Identified
The mobile site is showing "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information)." This appears to be a JavaScript error preventing the site from loading properly on mobile devices.

## Investigation Plan

1. **Check for JavaScript errors in the codebase**
   - Review the main JavaScript files that could cause client-side exceptions
   - Look for mobile-specific JavaScript that might be failing
   - Check for any recent changes that might have broken mobile functionality

2. **Review the site structure**
   - Examine index.tsx (which was modified according to git status)
   - Check for any Next.js/React specific issues that could cause hydration errors
   - Look for any mobile-specific components or logic

3. **Identify common causes**
   - Window/document references without proper checks
   - Missing dependencies or imports
   - API calls failing on mobile
   - Responsive design issues causing JavaScript errors

4. **Fix the identified issues**
   - Add proper error handling
   - Ensure all browser APIs are properly checked before use
   - Add mobile-specific error boundaries if needed

5. **Test the fixes**
   - Verify the error is resolved
   - Ensure the mobile experience works as expected

## Next Steps
I'll start by examining the modified index.tsx file and looking for any JavaScript that could be causing client-side exceptions on mobile devices.

## Review - Changes Made

### Issues Identified
1. **Missing Error Boundary**: The application lacked global error handling, which made it difficult to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.
2. **Potential URL handling issues in SEO component**: The SEO component could throw errors if `url` or `image` props were undefined when calling `.startsWith()`.
3. **Static export configuration**: The site is configured for static export to GitHub Pages, which can cause hydration issues if not handled properly.

### Changes Implemented

1. **Created ErrorBoundary Component** (`/components/ErrorBoundary/index.tsx`):
   - Implements React's error boundary pattern to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree
   - Displays a user-friendly error message instead of a blank screen
   - Includes a "Try again" button to recover from errors
   - Shows error details in development mode for debugging

2. **Updated _app.tsx**:
   - Wrapped the entire application with the ErrorBoundary component
   - This ensures any unhandled errors are caught and displayed gracefully

3. **Fixed SEO Component** (`/components/SEO/index.tsx`):
   - Added optional chaining (`?.`) to safely check if URLs start with 'http'
   - Added fallback empty strings to prevent undefined concatenation
   - This prevents potential runtime errors when URL or image props are undefined

4. **Created _document.tsx**:
   - Added a custom document to ensure proper HTML structure
   - Sets the language attribute for accessibility
   - Provides a clean base for any future document-level customizations

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test the site on mobile devices to verify the error is resolved
2. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify that all pages load correctly without client-side exceptions
4. Test navigation and interactive features on mobile devices

### Additional Considerations
- The error boundary will now catch and display any JavaScript errors that occur
- If specific errors persist, they will be logged to the console with more details
- The static export configuration means all data fetching happens at build time, reducing potential runtime errors
